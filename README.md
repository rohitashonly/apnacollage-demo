Good morning/afternoon,
My name is Rohitash Saini, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from The ICFAI University, Jaipur. I am in my final year and have a strong interest in Cloud Computing, DevOps, and System Administration.

I have hands-on experience with Python, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and AWS services through academic projects and internships. I also have experience in building CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments, and working with containerization tools.

Apart from my technical skills, I am a quick learner, a team player, and passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. My short-term goal is to work in a challenging role where I can enhance my technical expertise and contribute to the organization's growth.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
